# Synthesis and Sequencing using PD

"An 'introductory' Year 1 single semester module that guides students through the process of building basic synthesisers and sequencers utilising Pure Data or Purr Data software, and Apple Logic Pro. 

Though our lectures are 55 mins in duration, you should deliver for just 10-15 minutes of a lecture. You should finish your abridged lecture by giving indicative content of the remaining 40-45 minutes."

Pd patches are available above and slides are available from Google Docs [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TbulIZmY_hHMmmi_lyGcpqFzDaOWq-DLuEv2Bbtzllo).
